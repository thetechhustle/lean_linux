### Understanding an Email 

Before we delve into the technicals, let's start with a high-level view of what an email looks like. Essentially, an email is composed of two core segments: the **Header** and the **Body**.

The **Header** 📚

This is the information superhighway where routing and sender/receiver details are stored. The header is made up of several parts:

- **From**: This field shows the sender's email address. 
- **To**: Here's where you find the recipient's email address.
- **Subject**: The subject of the email appears here. It's a brief description of what the email is about.
- **Date**: This field contains the date and time the email was sent. 

And many more like Cc, Bcc, etc. Each line in the header is formatted as follows:

```
Header-Field: Content
```
The **Body** 📝

This is the meat of the email - where the actual message is written. It's what your recipient reads once the email is opened. It can contain plain text, HTML content or even attachments transformed into text via base64 encoding.

### The More Technical Aspect

Let's examine a simple email from a more technical perspective. Here is a basic structure of an email:

```
From: Alice <alice@example.com>
To: Bob <bob@example.com>
Subject: Hello Bob! 
Date: Mon, 25 Oct 2021 14:30:00 -0500
Message-ID: <1234@example.com>

Hello Bob,
How are you doing?
Best,
Alice
```
Each line of the header is a key-value pair, marked by a ':'.

And after the headers, a blank line indicates the start of the body, the actual message of the email.

This seemed pretty straightforward, right? 😄 But here comes the slightly complicated part.

### MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) 📎

MIME is used when you want to send content other than plain text, like attachments or HTML formatted emails.

Here's what an email with MIME content and an attachment would look like:

```
From: Alice <alice@example.com>
To: Bob <bob@example.com>
Subject: Report
Date: Mon, 25 Oct 2021 14:30:00 -0500
Message-ID: <1234@example.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="frontier"

--frontier
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello Bob,
Please find the attached report.
Best,
Alice

--frontier
Content-Type: application/pdf; name="Report.pdf"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="Report.pdf"

JVBERi0xLjQKJe/...rest of encoded pdf...
--frontier--
```

In this email, 'frontier' is a unique string that won't appear in the rest of the email. The 'frontier' lines separate different parts of the email, helping the recipient's email client understand where the different sections begin and end. 

That was a brief tour through the anatomy of an email, and there's much more depth to it. Remember, understanding the mechanism helps you troubleshoot issues and gain full control over your Linux mailing system.

So fellow learners, let's gear up for the exciting ride ahead and keep decoding the cryptic world of Linux emails! 💡
