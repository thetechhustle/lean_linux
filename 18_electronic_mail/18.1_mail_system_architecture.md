## 18.1 Mail System Architecture 🏛️ 

The **Mail System Architecture** forms the foundation of the entire email network. It's much like a city's blueprint, containing an intricate network of elements that interact with each other to ensure an email's smooth journey from its sender to recipient.

In this section, we will explore the key components of this architecture, their functions, and how they collectively contribute to the operation of the complete mail system. Let's get started! 

### User Agent 📍

The **User Agent (UA)**, also called a mail client, is where the email journey starts. The UA helps users to compose, manage and read emails. Some common examples are **Thunderbird**, **Outlook**, and **AppleMail** on standalone machines, and **mutt**, **pine**, or **alpine** on Linux systems.

```shell
$ apt-get install mutt
```

The above command is an example of how to install mutt, a text-based mail client on a Linux system.

### Mail Server and Mail Transfer Agent 🚚

The **Mail Server** is home to the **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)** which is the engine that powers the email's journey. It accepts the email from the UA, decides the routing based on the recipient's address and forwards it to the appropriate mail server. On Linux systems, **Exim**, **Sendmail**, and **Postfix** are popular MTAs.

Here's an example of how to install Postfix:

```shell
$ apt-get install postfix
```

### Mail Delivery Agent and Mailbox 🏡

The **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA**) lives on the recipient's mail server. The MDA receives the email from the MTA and routes it to the recipient's **Mailbox**. 

The Mailbox is the final destination in the journey. It is where emails are stored until the recipient's User Agent retrieves them.

Below is an example of setting up the Maildir format (a popular Mailbox format) on a user’s server:

```shell
$ maildirmake ~/Maildir
```
