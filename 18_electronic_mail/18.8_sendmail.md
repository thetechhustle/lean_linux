## 18.8 Sendmail 💌

Sendmail is one of the oldest and most widely used Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) on Unix-based systems, including Linux. It's incredibly flexible, capable, and robust. While it can be a bit complex, don't worry! It's exactly what we're here to help you navigate. Let's plunge into the world of Sendmail and understand how it can bolster your email handling game. 

### An Overview of Sendmail 💡

Sendmail began its journey in the early days of the internet, carrying the responsibility of delivering the lion's share of all email traffic. Today, it remains an excellent choice for extravaganza email setups, especially ones with complex routing requirements or extensive aliasing.

One of the standout abilities of Sendmail is its malleability in the face of changing network conditions. Due to its "queue first, deliver later" approach, Sendmail ensures that your messages are buffered and then transmitted even in the event of temporary network disruptions.

### Sendmail Configuration 🛠️

While Sendmail is a powerful MTA, it's equally infamous for its complex configuration file syntax. Unlike other services, Sendmail’s enormous flexibility comes with a somewhat convoluted configuration language known as M4 macros. Not to worry though; we're here to demystify it! Below is an example of how to configure Sendmail.

First, install Sendmail through your distro’s package system. For instance, on Debian or Ubuntu, you can use:

```
sudo apt install sendmail
```

On Fedora or CentOS, you can use:

```
sudo dnf install sendmail
```

Once installed, Sendmail’s configuration files are usually located in `/etc/mail`. The main two files you’ll work with are `sendmail.mc` and `sendmail.cf`.

The `sendmail.mc` file is the one that you tweak to change the `sendmail.cf` file, a file that you really don't want to alter manually due to its complexity.

The mc file reads like a K-configuration file, but is actually an M4 macro file. This macro setup allows you to make changes in a high-level language and then compile it down to the low-level `sendmail.cf` config.

For instance:

```
dnl # This is the sendmail macro config file. This is only an example. 
VERSIONID(`example config') 
OSTYPE(linux)
DOMAIN(generic)
MAILER(smtp)
MAILER(procmail)
```
When you make your changes in `sendmail.mc`, you need to compile it into `sendmail.cf`. To do so, use the m4 command:

```
m4 sendmail.mc > sendmail.cf
```

And voila! Your changes are now a part of the active Sendmail configuration.

### Wrapping Up Sendmail 🎁
