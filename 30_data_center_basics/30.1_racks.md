## 30.1 Racks

Welcome to the corridors of the data center, lined not with shelves carrying books but with towering racks holding servers. Each rack is the equivalent of a bookshelf, with each server comparable to a book. 📘🖥️

Just as a librarian uses a classification system to arrange books, data center professionals use rack units (also known as `U` or `RU`) to organize servers efficiently. Traditionally, one rack unit is equal to 1.75 inches of vertical space in a rack, with standard rack heights being 42U (73.5 inches).

Now, let's explore how Linux professionals interact with these racks.

**Assigning Server Space in the Rack:**
The process of assigning servers their slots within the rack is critical and follows a strategy of inventory management. Each server (or "book" in our library analogy) has its `U` space allocated. This space allocation is meticulously recorded for efficient use and tracking.

A sample command to list the status of servers in your rack could look something like:

```bash
$ rackcli list --rack Rack1
```

In this example, `rackcli` is an imaginary command-line utility used to manage the racks, and `Rack1` is the name of a specific rack in the data center. 

**Accessing Servers:**
Once servers are housed in the rack and powered on, you often need to remotely access them for various management tasks. This hinges on the enablement of SSH (Secure Shell) on the server, which essentially allows you to control the server as if you were sitting right in front of it.

Take the following as an example of how to SSH into a server:

```bash
$ ssh username@server_IP_address
```

Here, `username` is your account on the remote server, and `server_IP_address` is the IP address assigned to the server.

Rack management is not just about arranging servers physically; it's also about remote access and troubleshooting. Knowing what's where and how to find it is as essential in a data center as it is in a library. 📚💻🔧
