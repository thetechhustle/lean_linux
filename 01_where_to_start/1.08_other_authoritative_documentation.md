# 1.08 Other Authoritative Documentation

Learning to navigate Linux requires more than just hands-on experience. One of the essential skills you‚Äôll need on your journey is the ability to find, understand, and make use of authoritative documentation. Here, in this section, we'll focus on introducing some of the key sources of authoritative documentation for Linux that will assist you in your learning.

## Linux Documentation Project

Let's start with the **Linux Documentation Project (LDP)**. This project is like the library of Alexandria for Linux, a rich trove of guides, tutorials, and detailed manpages. It provides information on everything from shell scripting basics to kernel compilation procedures.

To access LDP, you just need to open your favorite web browser and type in 'www.tldp.org'. The website has a very intuitive interface, with different sections catering to beginners, intermediate, and advanced users. 

For instance, if you're just starting, you would likely find the 'Guides' section helpful as it contains a number of how-to documents tailored for beginners.

## Linux Kernel Documentation

The **Linux Kernel Documentation** is, as the name suggests, focused squarely on the kernel‚Äî the heart of Linux. As the kernel is a highly complex and critical part of any Linux system, this documentation is more advanced and technical. However, if you're pursuing a deeper understanding of Linux, this should be your go-to source.

You can access the kernel documentation at 'www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/'. Remember, it's a fantastic resource, but also highly technical. Prepare yourself for some serious learning!

## Official Distro Documentation

Every Linux distribution provides its own **Official Documentation**, tailor-made for its specific system configurations. Whether you are using Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, or any other distribution, you ought to be familiar with its official documentation. It proves extremely helpful when installing software, troubleshooting issues, or understanding the unique aspects of the distribution.

Official distro documentation can be found on the respective websites of each Linux distribution. For example, if you're using Ubuntu, you can find official Ubuntu documentation at 'help.ubuntu.com'.

Remember, in the realm of Linux, documentation is your guidebook ‚õ∞Ô∏èüìñ. Whether you're a beginner grasping fundamental concepts, or an advanced user delving into the kernels, authoritative documentation will always guide your way. Don‚Äôt forget, even the most seasoned Linux users often return to these resources. They are not just references, but toolsets for growth, exploration, and continual learning.## Linux Documentation Project
