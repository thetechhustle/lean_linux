## 1.06 Units

We engage in conversations yielding bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and even terabytes every day. But what do these terms truly mean? Comprehending units in Linux is not only crucial for your system administration skills but also serves as the universal language of computation. 🌐💻

You might already know that `1 Kilobyte (KB)` stands for `1024 bytes`. Traditionally, this binary system had been used; however, these definitions can switch to the decimal system in some contexts (especially in storage devices), meaning `1 KB` will equate to `1000 bytes` in such cases. Confusing, isn't it? 😕 

In the Linux world, we adopt a standard called `IEC` to avoid this confusion. Here's a brief intro to this standard:

- `1 KiB (Kibibyte)` = `1024 bytes`
- `1 MiB (Mebibyte)` = `1024 KiB`
- `1 GiB (Gibibyte)` = `1024 MiB`
- `1 TiB (Tebibyte)` = `1024 GiB`

This `IEC` standard uses the binary system (base 2) and provides clear differentiation from the decimal system (base 10) prevalent in mainstream storage. This way, there's no ambiguity! 😄

There is another essential unit in the Linux world - the `bit`. A `bit` is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of `binary digit`. The `bit` represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0".

Now, let’s put this knowledge into practice! 😎 

The `du` (disk usage) command in Linux calculates the file and directory size in blocks by default, and its `-h` (human-readable) option can show sizes in `KB`, `MB`, `GB`.

```bash
$ du -h ~/linux-with-ease.txt
4.0K    /home/user/linux-with-ease.txt
```

The `free` command allows you to see the amount of free and used memory in your system.

```bash
$ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7.7Gi       3.0Gi       2.0Gi       282Mi       2.7Gi       4.2Gi
Swap:          2.0Gi          0B       2.0Gi
```
With this foundational understanding of `units`, you can now easily gauge the scale of files, the capacity of your storage, and the status of your system's memory. Go ahead and explore this further, play with commands, and get a feel for it. Don’t forget, practice makes perfect! 💪🚀
