### 1.01 Essential Duties of a System Administrator

A System Administrator, or SysAdmin is a troubleshooter, guardian, and overseer of servers. SysAdmins are the prime caretakers of a company's data and IT infrastructure, keeping the digital gears of the organization turning smoothly. Let's break down the essential duties of a system administrator:

1. **Server Maintenance:** Servers are the pulsating heart of any IT infrastructure, and it's the responsibility of the SysAdmin to ensure their proper functioning. This includes regularly updating software packages, patching security vulnerabilities, and optimizing server performance â€“ a mission-critical task to ensure the delivery of digital services.

2. **User Management:** SysAdmins also act as gatekeepers, managing user accounts and access rights. This involves creating, modifying, or deleting user accounts, managing passwords and user access to specific files or services. 

```bash
# Command to add a new user in Linux
sudo adduser username
# Command to delete a user in Linux

```
