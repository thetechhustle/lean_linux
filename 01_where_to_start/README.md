# Chapter 01: Where to Start

Embarking on a new journey can often be thrilling yet overwhelming. You stand at the threshold, eager to enter the realm of Linux, where opportunities and challenges await you. This is where your curiosity transforms into knowledge, and knowledge into power—power to shape the digital world, power to launch you into careers that are shaping the future. Welcome to the first step, the chapter aptly named “Where to Start”.

Imagine starting a puzzle with no corner pieces—a daunting task, isn’t it? This chapter is your corner piece, providing a clear starting point to the vast puzzle that is Linux. It's designed for you, the aspiring administrator and future architect, who might be feeling lost amidst the sea of information. Here, you’ll find the compass that points towards the key aspects of Linux necessary for your growth as a professional, whether you are aiming to be a Software Engineer, DevOps Specialist, Site Reliability Engineer, or a Cloud Expert.

We’ll kick off by deciphering the language of Linux in ‘1.05_notation_and_typographical_conventions’, helping you read and write the hidden scripts of this powerful platform like a seasoned linguist. ‘1.08_other_authoritative_documentation’ and ‘1.07_man_pages_and_other_on-line_documentation’ will introduce you to the treasure troves of knowledge that are just a click away, waiting to be explored.

We’ll walk you through ‘1.04_example_systems_used_in_this_book’ to ensure you're not just grasping theories but also looking at practical implementations that breathe life into these concepts. Understanding ‘1.01_essential_duties_of_a_system_administrator’ will unveil the roles and responsibilities that are the very heartbeat of any system's life-cycle.

A journey without knowing the destination isn’t much of a journey, is it? ‘1.12_specialization_and_adjacent_disciplines’ will map out the exciting paths you can take and the territories you can conquer with the power of Linux. With each specialization, you will discover new horizons and opportunities to enhance your career.

We recognize the vastness of this domain. Therefore, ‘1.13_recommended_reading’ will be your curated list of resources, ensuring that you continue to learn from the best even when you close this book. When you question where you can implement your newfound knowledge, ‘1.11_where_to_host’ will illuminate the various platforms where Linux makes itself at home, from personal servers to expansive cloud environments.

By understanding ‘1.06_units’, you will become fluent in the metrics of computation – a language that transcends barriers and equips you to measure and optimize systems for efficiency. ‘1.09_other_sources_of_information’ and ‘1.02_suggested_background’ will build on your foundation, enriching you with the wisdom to seek knowledge from the best sources and discern what background will give you an edge in your learning.

Finally, ‘1.10_ways_to_find_and_install_software’ and ‘1.03_linux_distributions’ will offer you the keys to the kingdom of applications and the diverse ecosystems that have evolved from the Linux lineage. Each distribution opens a door to a new world, each with its own rules and potentials.

Rest assured, you're not merely an observer but an active participant in this exploration. We provide detailed markdown files with code examples and clear explanations, matched with a sprinkle of emojis to make this learning experience both comprehensive and enjoyable.

Remember, the journey of a thousand commands begins with a single keystroke. This is your keystroke. This is where you take the control, navigate through the codes, and lay down the stones to the path leading to your aspirations. You have an exciting road ahead, and this chapter is your guide, your mentor, your toolkit.

Don't just stand at the doorstep. Step forward. It’s time to begin this adventure. Welcome to Chapter 01: Where to Start.
