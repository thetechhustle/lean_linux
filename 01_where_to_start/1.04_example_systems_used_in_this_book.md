## 1.04 Example Systems Used in This Book

Diving right into it, we're going to lay down the groundwork necessary to have a practical understanding of Linux in action. Remember, Linux isn't just a theoretical concept; it's a living, breathing system that is actively being used on servers, desktops, embedded systems, and more across the globe every second. To comprehend it fully, let's observe it in its natural habitat, the contexts where it comes to life.

### Over a cup of Ubuntu ☕🐧

One of the most favorite picks for beginners and experts alike, Ubuntu's friendly user interface and extensive online community make it an ideal example system to begin with. Almost all our command line examples, shell scripting, system process details, along with package handling will be demonstrated using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. This version is chosen as it aligns well with the standard Long-Term Support (LTS) releases of Ubuntu, ensuring that we're working with a stable, well-tested system.

```bash
# Update your system packages 
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Embark on CentOS 🚀💼

CentOS is another solid foundation for those seeking deeper understanding of Linux. Known for its free and enterprise-focused structure, it's a top-choice for businesses worldwide. Due to its wide usage in enterprise solutions, we'll utilize CentOS 7 to demonstrate enterprise-specific topics. 

```bash
# Updating system packages in CentOS
sudo yum update -y
```

### The Heartbeat of Raspberry Pi ❤️🖥️

To walk you through the interesting world of embedded systems, we'll be using Raspberry Pi running Raspbian OS. Raspberry Pi is a fascinating microcomputer, and featuring it as one of our example systems will surely provide you with some impressive hands-on experiences.

```bash
# Checking the OS version in Raspbian
cat /etc/os-release
```

### Virtualization with VirtualBox ⛏️💻

VirtualBox provides a safe, controlled environment to practice implementing Linux systems without the fear of damaging your physical machine. Consider it as your sandbox for experimenting, making mistakes, and learning. We'll demonstrate creating virtual environments, installing different Linux distributions, and configuring network settings in these virtual systems.

```bash
# Checking the status of VirtualBox service
systemctl status vboxdrv
```

In the journey ahead, always remember, only through seeing Linux applied in diverse contexts, can we truly grasp its flexibility and power. The ability to handle and optimize Linux in a variety of systems and environments is a skill set desired by employers worldwide, and this book aims to help you build it. By extensively using these four example systems —Ubuntu, CentOS, Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, and VirtualBox— throughout this book, we're laying the cornerstone for your versatile Linux skills. So, put on your coding cap and let's get started! 🎓🐧🚀.
