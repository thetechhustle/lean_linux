### 03.3 Extensions to the Standard Access Control Model 🔧⛓️

As you master the basics of access control, it's time to deepen your knowledge with advanced techniques that go beyond the standard model. These tools allow for superior and more granular control, enabling you to customize permissions to the nth degree—fine-tuning your Linux system's security.

Let's explore two valuable extensions to standard Linux permissions—Access Control Lists (ACLs) and the setuid, setgid, and sticky bits.

#### Access Control Lists (ACLs) 📋🔐

ACLs are an extra layer of permissions you can apply to files and directories, providing a more detailed control level than traditional read, write and execute permissions. Use ACLs to give specific users or groups further access to resources without altering the file’s primary group or owner.

Here is how you set an ACL permission:

\````
setfacl -m u:username:rwx file
\````

In this command, `-m` is to modify the ACL, `u:username:rwx` means we're giving read, write, and execute permissions to the user ‘username’ on the file named ‘file’.

To view the ACL permissions of a file, use the `getfacl` command:

\````
getfacl file
\````

#### Setuid, Setgid, and Sticky Bits 💫🧩

These special permissions offer another layer of access control. The 'setuid' (Change User ID) permission allows users to run an executable with the permissions of the executable's owner. This is particularly useful for executables that require higher privileges, like changing a user's password.

The 'setgid' (Change Group ID) permission works similarly, but with group permissions. When applied to directories, all files created within will inherit the group of the directory, maintaining consistency.

The 'sticky bit' is mostly used on directories, restricting deletion of files. Only the owner, root, or a user with write permissions to the directory can delete files, even if they have write permissions to the file. This is notably used in the /tmp directory.

Here's how you set these special permissions:

\````
chmod u+s file   # Setuid
chmod g+s file   # Setgid
chmod o+t file   # Sticky bit
\````

Remember, these tools are powerful 🚀🔐. Always use them with discretion and understand the potential risks they introduce. With careful use, these extensions can tighten your system’s security and offer greater control of your Linux kingdom.
