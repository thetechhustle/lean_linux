**üîê Understanding File Ownership and Permissions**

In the UNIX-based system such as Linux, every file and directory are assigned three kinds of owners, known as USER, GROUP, and OTHERS. 

- USER : The owner of the file. Usually, the person who created the file.
- GROUP : The group that the owner is in. Every user can be a part of a few groups.
- OTHERS : Everyone else who has access to the server.

File permissions define what actions the USER, GROUP, and OTHERS can perform on a file or directory. These are represented as `r` (read), `w` (write), and `x` (execute). In the terminal, you can view these permissions with `ls -l` command. A sample output would look like `-rw-r--r--`.

**üîë The Meaning of Symbols and Numbers**

Each file or directory permission is also represented in numbers:

- Read (r) : 4
- Write (w) : 2
- Execute (x) : 1
- No Permission : 0

It means a permission of `-rw-r--r--` can also be represented as `644`. The first 6 grants the USER read and write permissions, the 4 grants the GROUP read permission, and the last 4 allows OTHERS to read the file.

**üèπ Changing File Permissions**

The `chmod` command is used for changing permissions. By using `chmod`, you can change the permissions for USER(owner), GROUP, and OTHERS. 

For example, if we want to give execute permissions to the USER, we can use the command[^1^]:

```
chmod u+x filename
```

You may also set the permissions in numeric form. Giving all permissions to everyone can be done by[^2^]:

```
chmod 777 filename
```

Word of caution here: it's generally a bad practice to set `777` permissions. It allows anyone to do anything with the file and compromises the security.

**üõ†Ô∏è Managing Ownership**

In Linux, you can also change the ownership of a file using the `chown` command[^3^]:

```
sudo chown user:group filename
```

**üö® Remember**

Managing permissions and ownership is a critical part of maintaining system security. Being aware of who has what level of access can help in reducing potential attack vectors.
