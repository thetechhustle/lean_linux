### 21.1 Meet Network File Services

Welcome to the beating heart of NFS! 🌐💓 As the acronym suggests, the Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol that allows users to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed. 

What does this mean? Well, imagine you are sitting at your computer, working on a report. But wait! You remember you have some important data stored on another device across the room. Does this mean you have to engage in manual data transfer, use external devices, or start sending emails to yourself? Not with NFS! 🎉

#### NFS: The Science Behind the Magic 🔮

Fundamentally, NFS empowers a computer to mount file systems over a network. What's mounting? Consider it a way to incorporate a foreign file system into your existing directory structure. When a file system is mounted, you can browse, read, write, and interact with it as if it were natively part of your machine. 

In the case of NFS, you no longer have to think about whether the file system is on your laptop, your server, or your Raspberry Pi, as long as they are a part of the same NFS configuration. 

```BASH
sudo mount -t nfs server:/dir /mnt/nfs
```
Using this command in your Linux terminal with the correct server and directory names, you can mount a remote directory to your machine to explore or manipulate the data.

Note: ```sudo``` command allows you to run programs with the security privileges of another user (normally the superuser, or root). The ```mount``` command is used to mount NFS filesystems, -t nfs is used to specify the file system type, and server:/dir and /mnt/nfs are placeholders for the actual directory you intend to mount and where to mount it.

But don't worry about all that jargon for now! This chapter is all about breaking these terms down, making it accessible and fun to learn. 🚀

#### NFS: No Files are Foreign 🌍

NFS promotes collaboration and seamless work by reducing barriers and differences between machines. With NFS, sharing becomes easier, simpler - faster. Stay tuned to future sections where we dive deeper into the mechanics and how to set up your own NFS server. 🛰️💻🤓

That's it for our brief introduction. Now, let's chart our course deeper into the versatile universe of NFS. Coming up next; the NFS approach! 🚀
