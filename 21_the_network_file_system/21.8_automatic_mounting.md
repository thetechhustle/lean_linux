### 21.8 Automatic Mounting 🛠

Automatic mounting is the unnoted hero of ease and efficiency in NFS. It's akin to switching on your television to discover your favourite flick just started, eliminating the need for manual labor. Imagine not having to bother about mounting your file systems every time you boot your Linux device; that's the solace automatic mounting brings.

#### Understanding Automatic Mounting 🧐

Automatic mounting, or automounting, refers to the seamless way NFS manages the mounting of file systems across a network. This process is executed by a daemon called `automount`. When you try to access a directory within the NFS file system, `automount` mounts it in real-time. Conversely, if you're not using the file system, `automount` will unmount it after a specified downtime, saving you valuable system resources. 

#### Setting Up Automatic Mounting: A How-To Guide 👷 📚

To leverage the magic of automatic mounting, you first need to install the `autofs` package on your Linux machine. Using a terminal, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install autofs
```

Once `autofs` is installed, you can configure `automount` by editing the file `/etc/auto.master`. Every line in this file represents an automount map that consists of two parts: Directory (the path) and Map file (the NFS share specifics). 

Below is a sample line in the `/etc/auto.master` file:

```bash
/mnt/nfs /etc/auto.nfs
```

Here, `/mnt/nfs` is the directory where the remote file systems will be mounted, and `/etc/auto.nfs` is the map file containing the specifics of the NFS shares.

You'd want to add your shared directories in the `/etc/auto.nfs` file, following this format:

```bash
folder -fstype=nfs,rw,sync,hard,intr  nfs-server:/shared-folder
```

After adding all your NFS shares, reload `automount` using:

```bash
service autofs restart
```

Voila! 🎉 You have now set up automatic mounting for your NFS shares!



Automatic mounting is not only resourceful for managing file systems in a big network systematically, it reduces the daily manual overhead, providing you more time to focus on other vital tasks. To fully savor the benefits automatic mounting delivers, remember to keep learning and exploring trials, for every stride enhances your command over Linux.
