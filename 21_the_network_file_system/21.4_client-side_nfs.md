### 21.4 Client-Side NFS

Greetings once again, brave explorer! Have you ever wondered how to initiate the dance of data transmission? Wonder no more! As we venture into the client-side of NFS, you'll realize that every epic story needs a receptive audience. The NFS server may command the symphony, but it's the client that takes the stage. 🎭🎵

The client-side of NFS is where the magic of sharing truly becomes tangible. Let's dive right in, hand in hand with perhaps the most fundamental command: `mount`. This humble command is the key to accessing shared server resources directly on your client machine. 🗝️🎁

Let's start simple. Assume we already have a directory in the server shared via NFS. To mount this directory to your desired location in the client machine, you use a command like this:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs server:/shared_directory /mnt/nfs
```

In this command, `server:/shared_directory` represents the NFS server and the shared directory, while `/mnt/nfs` is where you want the shared directory to be accessible on your client machine. After this command, voila! You successfully mounted the NFS share to your client-side Linux system. 

But there's more. 🚀⭐️

Maybe you were dazzled by our previous talks about NFS v4 and identity mapping. What if you wanted to designate the NFS version explicitly when mounting? Well, specify the nfsvers or vers option like so:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=4 server:/shared_directory /mnt/nfs
```

Similarly, you can set other options, like 'ro' for read-only mode, 'rw' for read-write mode, and 'hard' or 'soft' for hard or soft mounting. For example:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,hard server:/shared_directory /mnt/nfs
```

Here, the read-write (rw) option allows you to modify files, while the 'hard' option ensures the NFS system will keep trying to access the server if it's unavailable.

To make all these NFS mounts permanent across reboots, you'll need to edit the `/etc/fstab` file. You can use any text editor and add your NFS share information like this:

```bash
server:/shared_directory /mnt/nfs nfs defaults 0 0
```

The 'defaults' option signifies the default options of 'rw', 'suid', 'dev', 'exec', 'auto', 'nouser', and 'async'.

We have merely skimmed the surface of client-side NFS, but even that holds immense power in your hands. 🦾🌐

To truly master NFS client operations, remember to persist with practice, patience, and a pinch of playfulness. And soon, the magic of NFS will be not just in your reach but within your grasp. 🏆✨

And now, let your NFS journey continue. The next stop? Identity mapping in NFS version 4. Full steam ahead! 🚂💨
