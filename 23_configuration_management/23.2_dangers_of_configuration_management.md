## 23.2 Dangers of Configuration Management

Configuration management (CM) is not just a string of IT commands; it's rather an art, a discipline, and like most disciplines, there exists a flip side. Here are some of the dangers of CM that could hamper the smooth operation of your systems: ⚠️

### Danger 1: Overconfiguration
Many times, there's a tendency to over-configure in an attempt to control all possible variables. This is like adding too many cooks, where instead of improving the overall taste, it leads to a chaotic kitchen. Limit configurations to what is essential and apt for your system. 🥣 🙅‍♀️

### Danger 2: Ignoring Scalability
As systems grow, it's necessary that the Configuration Management tools and techniques scale too. Failing to consider this aspect might translate into a system that can't support growth, thus becoming a bottleneck. Always factor in scalability. 📈⚖️

### Danger 3: Low Attention to Documentation
Lack of proper documentation is a perilous pitfall in any software development cycle, and the same applies to configuration management. Without proper documentation, it becomes difficult to track and understand systems causing unnecessary troubleshooting time. Leave no room for assumption; document as you go. 📝🔍

### Danger 4: Inefficient Issue Tracking
Unresolved or untracked issues can pile up, increasing system toxicity over time. Ensure an efficient tracking and fixing method to keep system issues at bay. 🐛🚫

### Danger 5: Neglecting Automation
Manually configuring servers is fraught with human error and time-consuming. Automating this process is crucial. Without automation, the system slowly becomes unmanageable, especially as it grows larger over time. 🤖

These are some of the potential dangers in configuration management but worry not! Being aware is being prepared. Be mindful of these pitfalls to avoid tweaks becoming troubles!\nThey are not to deter you but to help you craft your CM strategy wisely. Remember, the goal is to create a harmonious, efficient system. Be vigilant against these dangers that stand in your way towards the perfect orchestration of your Linux system. 🎼🛠️⚙️🌐
