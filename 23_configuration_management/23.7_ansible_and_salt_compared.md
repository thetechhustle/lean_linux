## 23.7 Ansible and Salt Compared ⚔️

Configuration management tools have evolved over the years to cater to diverse needs and environments. Two such powerhouses in this arena are Ansible and Salt. Through this subchapter, we will pit them against each other, dissecting their strengths, weaknesses and most importantly, helping you choose which is the best tool for your needs.

### Popularity and Ease of Use 🏆 

Ansible has gained a lot of respect in the community for its simplicity. It utilizes YAML for its playbook language, which many find very syntactically appealing and human-readable. It's straightforward to set up, and its agentless architecture wins a lot of people over.

On the other side, Salt is less popular, but don't let that deter you. DevOps professionals who use Salt often praise its speed and scalability. It uses Python, which makes it a bit tougher than Ansible for beginners, but a joy to use for those familiar with the language.

### Scalability and Efficiency 🚀

While Ansible is excellent for managing smaller, simpler environments, Salt really shines when it comes to larger, complex deployments. Salt's use of a master-minion model allows it to scale efficiently and execute commands across thousands of servers quickly.

Ansible's agentless nature means all commands are pushed from the control node, which can become a bottleneck in large environments.

### Customization and Extensibility 🛠️

Salt supports several renderer systems for its files (Jinja, HCL, Wempy and more!), providing you with the flexibility to choose the best way to express your infrastructure code. It is also easily extensible, giving you the freedom to write your own execution modules.

Ansible supports Jinja2 for templating but lacks the breadth of renderer systems that Salt provides. In terms of extensibility, Ansible can be extended by writing modules in any language that can return JSON.

### Community and Documentation 👥

Ansible boasts a more extensive community and support system. It means more readily available solutions, modules, roles and playbook examples for users to learn from.

Salt, while having a smaller community, provides comprehensive and well-written documentation which can be a deciding factor for many when choosing a configuration management tool.

### Conclusion ⚖️ 

Both Ansible and Salt have their strengths and weaknesses. The choice to use one over the other hinges upon your team’s skills, your project requirements and the complexity and size of your environment.

Remember, the best tool is the one that your team can use effectively and helps solve the problem at hand with the least amount of friction. Happy orchestrating! 🎼🏁
