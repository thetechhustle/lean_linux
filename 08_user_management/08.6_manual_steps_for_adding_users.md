### 08.6 Manual Steps for Adding Users

Crafting a new user account manually is not just about assigning a unique ID and a password. It's an intricate process steeped with considerations around permissions, security, and usability. And guess what, you're about to become a master at that. 

Here are the steps to create a new user manually:

1. **Create a User 🧑🏻‍💻**
   - Use the `useradd` command alongside a new username. Remember, it should be unique and easily identifiable.
  
```bash
sudo useradd newuser123
```
Here 'newuser123' is the new username under which a new user account will be created.

2. **Create a Password 🔑**
   - Password is the primary gatekeeper to your system. It needs to be strong yet rememberable. Use the `passwd` command to assign a password to the new user.

```bash
sudo passwd newuser123
```
You'll be prompted to enter a new password and confirm it.

3. **Assign a Home Directory 🏠**
   - A home directory serves as the personal space for a user to store files and documents. It’s generated automatically unless you want to assign one manually. Use `-d` flag to define a custom home directory.
 
```bash
sudo useradd -d /home/customdirectory newuser123
```
Here, `/home/customdirectory` is the home directory for 'newuser123'.

4. **Ascribe a Proper Shell 🐚**
    - Shell is like the user's personal assistant. It interprets user commands and makes sure they are executed correctly. Assign the user to default shell bash using `-s` flag.

```bash
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash newuser123
```
Here, `/bin/bash` is the shell for 'newuser123'.

5. **Assign Supplementary Groups 🧩**
    - Groups help manage users with similar roles or permissions. Use `-G` to add the user to one or many existing groups.
  
```bash
sudo useradd -G group1,group2 newuser123
```
Here, 'newuser123' is added to 'group1' and 'group2'.

With that, you've manually created a user account, effectively defining their workspace, their tool (shell), and their colleagues (groups). As you practice, remember, this is how you chisel the perfect user-led environment. 

It's not just about 'adding a user'; it's about building an echo system where every user is heard, understood, and empowered to perform their best. Enjoy the process, dear navigator! 🚀
