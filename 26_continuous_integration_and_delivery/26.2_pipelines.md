# Subchapter: Pipelines

Pipelines, in the context of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), are a series of automated processes for getting software from version control right through to the user and customer. With the help of pipelines, you can automate your software delivery process: build, test, and deploy your code every time there is a change, based on the release process models that you establish. 🚀

## 26.2.1 Understanding Pipelines

In theory, a pipeline is a sequence of stages provided by you, where each stage is a series of jobs. Each job is a set of commands executed within a Docker container. In summation, pipelines process your code, build a new version of your software, run a series of tests to ensure quality, and deploy it, in an automated fashion. Automation reduces the manual overhead and error possibilities, enhancing the reliability of your software development processes. 💪👨‍💻👩‍💻

```bash
Version Control System --> Build -- > Quality Analysis --> Deployment
```

## 26.2.2 Building Your First Pipeline 

Let's try implementing a basic pipeline which automatically compiles and tests your code.

Step 1: Choose your version-controlled source code. This could be in Git, Bitbucket or any other system.

```bash
git clone <repository_link>
```

Step 2: Build your code. The build step translates source code into a binary that can be executed or run. 

```bash
gcc -o program sourcecode.c
```

Step 3: Implement basic automated testing. The command depends on the test framework you've decided to use.

```bash
./run-tests
```

Step 4: If all the tests pass, deploy your code. This could be moving your code to a production environment, or simply archiving the built assets.

```bash
mv program /deploy/directory/
```

As your project evolves, so will your pipeline. It can include stages like security testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing, production deployment, and many more based on your project requirements. 🌟🌟

In the space of CI/CD, pipelines shape up to be more than a simple tool—they become vital mechanisms that transform your code into a reliable, high-quality product. Through the automation of your software's lifecyle, pipelines reward you with improved continuous feedback, rapid problem-solving, and most importantly, a whole lot less time scrambling to fix bugs and deployment issues. 💼🎯👩‍💻👨‍💻

So ready your sails, as we journey further into the world of CI/CD. In the next section, we will explore Jenkins, a leading open source automation server, which can help us create more sophisticated pipelines. Onward to mastery! 📚🌟🚀
