## 26.1 CI/CD Essentials 💡

To fully grasp the concepts of Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD), you need to understand several key components at work within this methodology.

### What is Continuous Integration? 🤔

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate their code changes into a main branch of a shared repository several times a day. Each integration is then automatically verified by building the software and running automated tests on the build. 

This approach reduces integration problems and allows for rapid development and deployment of software. Imagine it as a bustling restaurant kitchen, where the delivery of each meal depends on every chef (developer) doing their part in perfect harmony.

```sh
git clone git@repository.com:project.git
git branch my-feature
git add --all
git commit -m "new feature added"
git push origin my-feature
```
In the code block above, a developer clones the project repository, creates a feature branch `my-feature`, makes changes and pushes the feature back to the remote library. The CI service then takes over verifying these changes.

### What is Continuous Delivery? 📦

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a practice that follows suit from CI, ensuring that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. In essence, it expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. 

```sh
kubernetes apply -f deployment.yaml
```
In the code block above, we’re deploying our application to a Kubernetes cluster.

### What are the Benefits of CI/CD? 🏆

Implementing CI/CD provides numerous benefits including:

1. **Detecting and rectifying issues early** - With frequent integration and automated tests, issues are detected much sooner, making them less disruptive, less complex and less costly to fix.
2. **Faster, more reliable releases** - Deliver faster and more frequent releases and updates, and with automated deployment, you're assured that the code is ready for production.
3. **Reduced manual effort** - Automation means less effort and fewer resources spent on boring, repetitive tasks. This leaves you free to focus on providing value.

### Pipeline Example 🚀

In a CI/CD framework, you work with a pipeline, which is a set of automated processes that allow developers to reliably and efficiently compile, build and deploy their code. Here’s an example of a very basic CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
pipeline:
  build:
    running:
      image: python:3.7
      script:
        - pip install pytest
        - pytest
  deploy:
    running:
      image: amazon/aws-cli
      script:
        - aws ecs update-service --service my-service --force-new-deployment
```
In this example, the `build` phase uses a Python image to run tests with pytest. If tests pass, the `deploy` phase runs, using an AWS image to force a new deployment on an ECS service.

CI/CD lays the foundation stone for a robust DevOps culture. With this knowledge, you're ready to dive deeper into building and working with pipelines! 🌟🚀
