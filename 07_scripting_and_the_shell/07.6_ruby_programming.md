## 07.6 Ruby Programming 💎

Welcome to the exciting land of Ruby Programming! Often referred to as the programmer’s best friend, Ruby emits an aura of elegance and simpleness. Whisking clear syntax alongside high-level abstraction, Ruby delivers a joyful coding experience while meeting all your programming requirements.

### Introduction to Ruby 🎓

Born in Japan and inspired by languages like Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp, Ruby is an expressive, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language. Its beauty lies in being simple in appearance but complex inside, emphasizing the **need of making programming more human-friendly** rather than machine-oriented. 🌸

### Installing Ruby 💽

In Linux, you can install Ruby using your package manager. Here is how you do it in Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```

To confirm the installation, check the version of Ruby installed:

```bash
ruby -v
```

### Ruby Syntax - The Essence of Clarity ☁️

In Ruby, _everything is an object_ and every operation you perform is a method applied to that object. No semi-colons at the end of lines and fewer parentheses make the syntax cleaner. Let's dive into some basics with a simple “Hello World!” example:

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!" 
```

'puts' is a method here that prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal. Simple, isn't it? 🌍

### Building Blocks of Ruby - Data Types, Variables, and Operators ⚙️

Ruby supports the following **data types**: numbers, strings, ranges, hashes, arrays, and symbols. You can declare **variables** without their data type, and they can hold any type of data:

```ruby
my_number = 25 # Numbers 
my_string = "Hello, Ruby!" # String 
```
Ruby also includes all basic operators like **arithmetic (`+, -, *, /, %, **`), comparison (`==, !=, >, <, >=, <=`)**, and assignment operators (`=, +=, -=, *=, /=`).** 🧮

### Control Flow in Ruby - Making Decisions ⚖️ 

Ruby offers conditional structures like `if`, `else`, `unless`, and `case`. Here's a simple example:

```ruby
temperature = 30

if temperature > 28
  puts "It's hot today!"
else
  puts "The weather is pleasant!"
end
```

### Iteration in Ruby - Looping Through 🎢 

Ruby boasts beautiful looping constructs such as `while`, `until`, `for in`, `each` loops.

```ruby
5.times do 
  puts "Iteration is fun!"
end
```
This program will print “Iteration is fun!” five times. 🔄

### Wrapping Up 🎁

The exploration of the world of Ruby hardly stops here. A plethora of methods, libraries, tools such as **Ruby on Rails** await you in future dives into this programmer-friendly language. And remember, just like Linux, don't be afraid to explore, experiment, and make mistakes with Ruby. Every stumble is yet another step towards computational fluency! 🚀
