### 04.3 ps: Monitor Processes

Linux works tirelessly, running processes at the heart of your system. As a maestro of Linux, it's crucial to know about these processes. For this, the "ps" command is your looking glass, your viewing portal to discover what's running in the background of your Linux system. 

- 🧩 **The Building Blocks**

    The `ps` stands for "process status," and it fetches information about the currently-running processes. Here's how you can use it directly from your terminal:

    ```bash
    ps
    ```
    You will see an output with a bunch of information categorized under four main headers – PID, TTY, TIME, and CMD. Let's dissect them:

    * `PID`: Process ID, a unique number assigned to each process.
    * `TTY`: Terminal type, which refers to the terminal that started this process.
    * `TIME`: CPU time, the 'life-time' of the process showing how much CPU usage it has taken.
    * `CMD`: Command, the actual command name that initiated this process.

- 🔎 **Dive Deeper**

    By simply running `ps`, you might feel like only a few processes are running, but this is not the actual scenario. Want to see all the processes? Use the `-e` option.

    ```bash
    ps -e
    ```
    -e is short for 'everyone,' and it shows you all the processes running on your system. Surprise, isn’t it!

- 🕵🏼‍♀️ **Customize Your View**

    You might want a different view to suit your requirements. For instance, watching processes run by a specific user, say 'root'. Use `-u` option followed by the username for this:

    ```bash
    ps -u root
    ```
    Now you’re seeing the world of processes from 'root's perspective.

Further examples of such options include `-p` for filtering by process ID, `-t` to filter by terminal, and so on.

- 🎛 **Playing with Options**

    Your control over the `ps` command does not end here. Linux gives you a plethora of options with the `ps` command. You can view processes based on their states (`-l`), list a hierarchy of processes (`--forest`), and much more!

- 💡 **Exploring the Process Universe**

    Combining multiple options can provide a more detailed and catered view. Ever thought of showcasing all the processes in a detailed list? Here’s how:

    ```bash
    ps -ef --forest
    ```
    In this command, `-ef` gives the complete information of every process, and `--forest` presents them in a hierarchy tossing out a process-family tree on your terminal screen.

`ps` is the beginning of your journey where you start to gain visibility over the bustling city of processes. You will equip yourself with discovering, monitoring and understanding them better as we step forward.

Remember, every maestro must know their orchestra before they can conduct it. Happy Exploring! 🐧🎵
