### 04.5 Nice and Renice: Influence Scheduling Priority

In the Linux city, not all processes play the same role. Some are key players and require more attention than others. To grant these processes the special consideration they deserve, Linux provides us with two commands, nice and re-nice.

#### The Nice Command ðŸ“œ:
The nice command is used to run a process with a modified scheduling priority. In other words, you can use it when starting a process to assign it a 'niceness' value, which determines its priority level. 

The 'niceness' scale ranges from -20 to 19. A process with a negative 'niceness' value is favored by the scheduler, while a positive one means the process is willing to share the CPU. This means that lower 'niceness' values equate to higher process priority.

Consider the following example, where we start a process with a niceness of 10:

```bash
$ nice -n 10 my_process
```

This line instructs the Linux scheduler to consider `my_process` as a polite citizen willing to give up its CPU needs in favor of more prioritized processes.

#### The Renice Command ðŸ”„:

While the nice command assigns priority at the birth of a process, what if you need to change the priority of an already running process? That's where renice comes in!

The renice command allows you to change the 'niceness' value of an existing process. This can be very useful when you realize an ongoing process needs more (or less) attention.

Suppose you have a running process with PID 12345, and you want to lower its priority:

```bash
$ renice +5 12345
```

This line tells the scheduler that the process with PID 12345 has decided to be 'nicer' and allow other processes to have more CPU time.

Remember, as the Linux maestro, you hold the power to direct every element of your system's performance. The nice and renice commands are just another tool you wield in creating a Linux environment that performs to your rhythm! 

Please note: Changing the 'niceness' of a process can significantly impact the performance of your system. Therefore, it should be done with careful consideration and comprehensive understanding of the process' role.
