## 04.2 The Life Cycle of a Process

Just as every living organism in the world undergoes a lifecycle, a process in Linux too passes through a predictable series of states from the moment of its creation to the termination. By understanding this lifecycle, you gain essential insight into how processes coexist and function within your Linux system. 🐣🌳💀

### 01. Creation

Every Linux process starts its life when it's born or created—this generally occurs for one of two reasons: 

- A parent process creates a new child process. This could be due to various reasons such as the need to perform a task in parallel or the necessity to execute a different program. In Linux, process creation is achieved via the `fork()` system call.

- The system boots up, automatically running a set of processes known as daemons.

When a process is created, it inherits most attributes from its parent process.

```bash
$ ps
PID   PPID  CMD
1001  1000  /bin/bash
1002  1001  ps
```
In the above, process `ps` with PID `1002` was created by the parent process `/bin/bash` with PID `1001`.

### 02. Ready

Once created, the process is now ready for execution. But, it needs to wait for its turn because, in a typical Linux system, many processes are ready-to-run, competing for the CPU's attention. These processes sit in a queue waiting to be scheduled for execution.

### 03. Running

When the Linux scheduler assigns the CPU to the process, it's now in the running state. The program's instructions are being executed till it finishes, is interrupted, or voluntarily gives up the CPU.

### 04. Interrupted

Often, a running process may enter a waiting (or blocked) state if it needs to wait for a resource (e.g., reading data from a disk). Here, the scheduler takes CPU away from the waiting process and gives it to another ready process. 

### 05. Zombie and Orphan 

In rare circumstances, you may come across unique types of processes:

- When a child process finishes execution, but the parent hasn't yet read its exit status, the child becomes a `Zombie` process. 🧟‍♂️

- An `Orphan` process is a child process that continues to run after the parent process has terminated. 🥺

### 06. Termination

Eventually, every process faces this inevitable stage—termination. This can happen in numerous ways: 

- The process finishes executing and terminates naturally. 

- The process is killed — either by a user or system administrator using various kill commands, or the system itself in the case of a critical error. 

That's it! Now you have a solid understanding of the fascinating life journey of a Linux process.

This understanding forms the foundation for many advanced concepts. With this knowledge, you will be able to navigate your way through the chaos, effectively managing your system and processes for optimal performance. 🚀🐧🥳
