## 15.2 Routing Daemons and Routing Protocols 🧙‍♂️

Routing daemons and protocols are the whisperers of data traffic; they form the heart of any routing system, including that of Linux. Let's gain some insights into how they assist in creating an efficient and reliable network.

### 15.2.1 What are Routing Daemons? 

Routing daemons are the background processes in a Linux system that handle the routing tables. They use the information from routing protocols to decide the best path for data packet transmission and keep the routing table updated, ensuring seamless navigation. 🗺

### 15.2.2 What are Routing Protocols? 

Routing protocols are the set of rules used by routers to communicate with each other. They contain the algorithms for determining the best path where data packets should be sent over a network. These protocols form the backbone of the internet. A few of the commonly used protocols are:

- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) 🔀
- RIP (Routing Information Protocol) 🔄
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) 🔃
- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) ↔️

Each of the protocols works differently and is suited for different types of networks. They enable the routers to make an informed decision about the shortest and least congested path.

### 15.2.3 Using Routing Daemons and Protocols in Linux 🐧

In Linux, there are several tools available for dealing with routing. One of them is ```route```, which is a command-line tool used to show/manipulate the IP routing table in Linux. Example: 

```
$ route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         _gateway        0.0.0.0         UG    600    0        0 wlan0
172.16.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.240.0.0     U     600    0        0 wlan0
192.168.122.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 virbr0
```

Yet another excellent tool is Quagga, an open-source routing software suite. It is capable of managing TCP/IP based protocols like OSPF, RIP, and BGP. To install Quagga, you can use the command:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install quagga quagga-doc
```

Once installed, you can configure it according to your routing needs. The configurations mainly depend upon which protocol you are using.

Operating routing daemons and protocols might seem overwhelming at first, but as you delve deeper into the Linux world, you'll find them integral part of networking and Linux mastery. Let's continue our journey and unveil more secrets of IP routing. 🕵️‍♂️💫
