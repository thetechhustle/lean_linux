## 15.5 Routing Strategy Selection Criteria 🛤️

While journeying through mapped network landscapes, not all paths are created equal. Choosing the best route for your data pack mules involves balancing costs, performance, reliability, and security. Here, we will guide you on selecting the optimal route based on carefully curated criteria.

### Costs 💵

In the world of networking, cost doesn't necessarily imply a financial metric. It's about quantifying the resources (bandwidth, delay, reliability, etc.) needed to ferry packets from one point to another. Your primary quest is to find the path with the lowest cost – it could mean the quickest route or the one that consumes fewer bandwidth resources.

Try invoking the Linux `ip route` command to list all the available routes. It offers a clear visual of how costs spread across the different paths.

``` bash
sudo ip route
```

### Performance 🎯

Setting sail on high seas of data, your vessel's speed and efficiency must remain top-notch. Performance can be a decisive factor, especially in scenarios where delay or latency is unacceptable. Consider your network's traffic patterns, peak periods, and real-time communication requirements when making routing decisions.

### Reliability 🔐

Not every sea is calm, and not every network pathway is reliable. Some may fall prey to blackouts or congestion in peak hours. A path's reliability largely depends on its track record of successful data delivery. It's wisest to select routes known for smooth sailing rather than promising yet untested newcomers. Tools like `MTR (My Traceroute)` can provide valuable insights into the reliability of different routes.

``` bash
sudo mtr <IP_ADDRESS_OR_DOMAIN_NAME>
```

### Security 🛡️

In the modern era, one cannot afford to compromise on security. Sensitize your route selection process towards paths with built-in security provisions, perhaps encrypted channels or ones that bypass risk-prone areas entirely. Routing via VPNs is a common practice employed to ensure safe transit of sensitive information.

The journey of network routing is one of continuous learning. There are no static answers, only dynamic solutions that adapt to the ever-evolving internet landscape. Just like the world explorer navigating through varying terrains, view each decision to select a routing strategy as another feather in your explorer's cap, another step towards becoming a true network maestro. 🌟🐧🌍.
