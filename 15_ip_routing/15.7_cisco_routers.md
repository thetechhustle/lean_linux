## 15.7 Cisco Routers 

Cisco is a globally renowned player in the networking domain and its routers are lauded for their robust performance and extensive feature set. Here, you'll take a guided tour into the world of Cisco routers as an integral part of Linux IP routing. 🚀

### 15.7.1 What's So Special About Cisco Routers?

Cisco routers stand out for their reliability, extensive functionality, and top-grade security features. They are true workhorses that efficiently manage complex networks day in and day out.

Like an industrious bee protects its hive, Cisco routers are formidable sentinels of network security. They come with an integrated firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), and advanced malware protection. 🐝🔒

### 15.7.2 Cisco Routers and Linux

You might wonder how Linux fits into the Cisco routing ecosystem. The answer is quite simple – through Cisco’s IOS (Internetwork Operating System), which has an embedded subset of Linux. This synergy brings out the best of both worlds - the power and flexibility of Linux and the innovative networking features of Cisco. 

To explore this further, we'll now take a dip into using Linux commands on Cisco routers. 🐧🌐

### 15.7.3 Linux Commands and Cisco Routers

The Linux command line interface (CLI) is second nature for seasoned Linux users. The good news is that Cisco IOS supports a vast array of Linux commands, which can be leveraged to inspect, configure, and manage the router. Let's look at a few examples:

- `show ip route` : This command, similar to `route -n` in Linux, displays the IP routing table of the Cisco router.
 ```bash
 Router#show ip route
 ```

- `show interfaces` : A parallel to `ifconfig` in Linux, this command provides detailed information about all network interfaces on the router.
```bash
Router#show interfaces
```

- `configure terminal` : Similar to `vi` or `nano` in Linux, this command launches global configuration mode, where you can modify the router's settings.
```bash
Router#configure terminal
```

### 15.7.4 Integrating Cisco Routers into Linux Networks

Deploying Cisco routers in Linux networks can enhance your network handling capacity, scalability, and security. Remember, the robust firewalls, impressive intruder detection systems, and cutting-edge malware protection in Cisco routers add an extra layer of security to your Linux network. 

Moreover, the deep integration between Cisco IOS and Linux brings a unified interface to your diverse network environments – something that other router brands may struggle to offer. 

That's the end of our whirlwind tour through the world of Cisco routers and their role in Linux IP routing. Cisco routers, with their modern features and Linux synergy, are indeed pivotal components in any high-performance, secure Linux network. 🌉🔐.
