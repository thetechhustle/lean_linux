## 17.1 Core SSO Elements

The magic of Single Sign-On is powered by a few core elements. Like the gears in a well-oiled clock, they work behind the scenes to provide you an experience of seamless authentication. Let's unmask the heroes of SSO in Linux: 💼

#### 1. Authentication Server

This is the chief orchestrator of the SSO symphony. An authentication server is a centralized system that confirms the identity of users. In SSO terms, it is the authority that verifies your secret handshake before granting you access. It's like the bouncer at a club who checks IDs at the entrance. 🕵️‍♂️

In Linux, popular authentication servers include Kerberos and LDAP. These servers are responsible for confirming user credentials and providing the necessary tokens for access. 

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install krb5-user libpam-krb5
```
Above command installs the Kerberos authentication server on Ubuntu/Debian Linux systems. 

#### 2. Service Providers

These are the services that users access during their journey. When an authenticated user approaches, service providers consult the authentication server to confirm the user's credentials. If the server gives a nod, access is granted! It's like the bartender who trusts the bouncer's scrutiny and serves you your favorite drink. 🍹

For instance, Google Workspace, AWS, GitHub, can all act as service providers in an SSO setup. 

#### 3. Tokens

Tokens are the VIP passes in this scenario. Once the authentication server authenticates a user, it issues a token. This token, containing user information, is used to gain access across various services. Much like a stamped hand at a festival, this token is your key to all the venues (services). 🎟️

```shell
$ kinit username
Password for username@REALM: [Enter your password]
```
Above commands are used to request a Kerberos token for a specific user 'username’ in the realm 'REALM', in Linux. 

Understanding these core SSO elements gives you a high-level view of the workings of Single Sign-On. With this newfound knowledge and a bit of practice, you can now navigate through the labyrinth of Linux systems with ease. Stay tuned for our deep dive into LDAP in the upcoming section.
