## 14.5 Building Wiring - The Pillars of your Castle🏰

In the medieval era, knights ventured far and wide, slaying dragons and saving kingdom. As brave as they were, even they relied on the security of castle walls at the end of the day. In our journey into networking realms, these castle walls are akin to the **building wiring**. It is the foundation on which your network castle stands. But how do these walls get built? Let’s explore, brave Knight! 🏰🔌🖥

### Understanding the Basics

The foundation of physical networking rests primarily on two categories of cables - **Coaxial cable** and **Twisted Pair cable**. Their purpose? To transmit data signals from one point to another. Just like the various paths to a castle, different cables have their strengths, weaknesses and use-cases.

**Coaxial cable** 🖇 is a type of copper cable specially designed with a metal shield and other components engineered to block signal interference. It is primarily used in broadband systems, such as cable TV and internet.

Alternatively, **Twisted Pair cables** are commonly used in many networks owing to their stability, speed, and affordability. There are two types:

1. **UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair** 🧶: Relatively cheaper and easier to handle, UTP does not have foil or braid shielding around it. It's commonly used in telephony and can be a smart choice for small setups where networking demands are not heavy.

2. **STP - Shielded Twisted Pair** 🧵: Comes with additional layers of protection against interference, allowing for consistent signal quality. A go-to for larger networks with high-speed data flows.

### The Art of Network Cabling 🎨

Every fortress has a blueprint. A well-planned network cabling map can:

- Ensure your network is efficient, reliable and scalable.
- Save costs in long-run maintenance.
- Prevent signal interference, thereby guaranteeing quality connectivity.

Here are some tips to create an optimal network wiring plan:

🧭 **Identify Your Needs:** How many computers, devices, and services will be connecting? Understand this before running your cables.

🎛 **Centralize:** Desirable to have a central "hub" where your primary network devices and connections exist. This hub is at times referred to as 'Demarcation Point' or 'Point of Presence'.

🔌 **The Long and Short of It:** Remember that Ethernet standards limit the length of a run between devices to around 100 meters for CAT5e and CAT6 cables. Plan your device placements and cable runs accordingly.

📏 **Measure Twice, Cut Once:** Calculate the precise length of cable you will need before making a cut and never "stretch" your cable.

🚫 **Avoid Electrical Interference:** Keep UTP cables at least six inches away from electrical wires.

👥 **Don’t Go Solo:** Opt for professional help if you’re unfamiliar with network cabling. It could save you from potential expensive mistakes.

### Safety First!

Lastly, the knights of yore never neglected their defenses, and neither should you. Complying with building, electrical, and safety codes should be paramount when handling building wiring. And don’t forget to always wear the appropriate safety gear. ⚠️👷‍♀️

Embark now, dear Knight, on building the walls of your network fortress with precision, knowledge, and an eye for detail. Your mastery over the utilitarian art of building wiring will determine the strength and endurance of your network castle in the web's tempestuous storms. Step forth now onto the path of the network architect, the crafter of connectivity, the weaver of the web. Onward to victory! 🏰🥇🎉
