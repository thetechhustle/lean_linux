## 14.6 Network Design Issues

Greetings, intrepid programmers! It's time to delve into the labyrinthine depths  of network design. This section will guide you through the maze, illuminating key design principles and dispelling many of the shadows that make network design seem so daunting.

### Determining Requirements 📝

Your first step in crafting a network design is to determine your network's requirements, just like a builder lays the foundation of a castle.🏰

- **Traffic Estimation 🚦:** Start by estimating the traffic you expect your network to handle. This includes considering peak and off-peak hours and the presence of any time-critical applications.

- **Growth Assessment 🌱:** Keep the anticipated growth of your network in mind. Infrastructures grow and needs change — your design should accommodate this inevitable growth.

### Creating a Subnet Design 🕸️

Next, create a subnet design that fulfills these requirements. This involves:

- **IP Addressing Scheme 💡:** Decide on your IP addressing scheme. Keep it logical and scalable as it will define your network’s boundaries.

- **Subnet Division 🗺️:** The logical division of your network into smaller, manageable pieces i.e., subnets. This comes with its set of criteria.

### Handling Redundancy ♨️

Redundancy can be a blessing in disguise! While it adds complexity and cost, it's a crucial safeguard in network design.

- **Network Redundancy 🎯:** Achieve this by building multiple pathways through your network for data to traverse. Should one pathway go down, data can continue to flow.

- **Device Redundancy 📲:** This includes ensuring critical network devices such as routers and switches have backups in case of failures to ensure continuous service.

### Security Considerations 🛡️

Last but certainly not the least, Security! Like the  ever-watchful guards at a fortress gate, your network-security must remain vigilant.

- **Firewall Incorporation 🔥:** Just as a moat protects a castle, a well-implemented firewall protects your network from external hostile forces.

- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems 🚨:** These are the silent sentinels that detect and thwart potential threats before they can harm your network.

It's essential to approach Network design with the patience of an alchemist, the precision of a archer, and the curiosity of a cartographer. Remember — every castle was once a blueprint before the first stone was laid.

So, brace yourselves, heroes. Unravel the knots, lay down pathways, and fashion a network that stands resilient in face of adversity. For it's the mark of true engineers to not just create, but to craft with foresight, wisdom & adaptability. 🌐🛠️⚙️
