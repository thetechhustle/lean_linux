### 24.1 Virtual Vernacular

Welcome to the world of virtualization! Before we delve deeper into the practical applications, let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with the key terms and concepts in this expansive domain. It's like learning a new language, and this vernacular will pave the way for easier understanding and implementation of virtualization concepts. So, let's get started! 📚

**Hypervisor** 🎩 

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a piece of software, firmware, or hardware that generates and runs virtual machines. It's the driving force behind virtualization, dividing physical hardware resources amongst multiple virtual environments. They are mainly of two types: Type-1 (Native/Bare-Metal) and Type-2 (Hosted).

**Virtual Machine (VM)** 💻 

A virtual machine is a self-contained operating system that operates as if it were an independent computer. In reality, it's a bubble within your physical machine, taking a part of the host's resources to run software independently.

**Guest and Host Systems** 🔄 

These are common terms in the realm of virtualization. The _host system_ refers to the physical machine where the hypervisor is running, whereas the _guest system_ refers to the VMs that the hypervisor creates.

**Emulation** 🎭 

Emulation is the process where one system imitates another. Unlike virtual machines, which believe they're running on actual hardware, emulated systems know they're being emulated, and the emulation software translates code intended for one processor to another. 

**Containerization** 📦

Containerization is like the younger sibling of virtualization. It involves enclosing an application in a container with its operating system. This method allows the containerized application to run on any other system seamlessly, regardless of any disparities in the OS details.

**vCPU (virtual CPU)** 💽

A vCPU stands for virtual central processing unit. It is a portion of a physical CPU that is assigned to a VM. By assigning multiple vCPUs to your VM, you can make multiple processes run concurrently.

Understanding this terminology will help untangle the complexities of virtualization and enjoy the process of learning. After all, communication is key, even when you're talking to machines! 🔑

With these definitions in your vocabulary, you're all set to step into the grill and start virtualizing with Linux. So, keep this glossary handy, and let's gear up for a fascinating journey ahead. Up next, Virtualization with Linux! 👨‍💻👩‍💻
