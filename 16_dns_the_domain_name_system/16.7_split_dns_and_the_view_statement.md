## 16.7 Split DNS and the View Statement 🎭🔭

Split DNS is a concept that resembles a magician's disappearing act. It's like presenting different sides of the same trick to different viewers. In essence, it’s a technique of showing different data based on the requester’s source IP address. On a server, one set of DNS information is typically shown to internal clients, and another, often less detailed setup, is shown to external clients. This segmentation promotes security 🛡 and efficiency 🚀.

The `view` statement used in BIND accomplishes this task. With a `view` clause, BIND can provide different responses to queries that come from different networks. 

### Example:

Consider a scenario where our corporate network has address 192.0.2.0/24 and we want to return different data depending on whether the client is internal or external. We can use `view` clause like this:

```bash
view "internal" {
  match-clients { 192.0.2.0/24; }; // our network
  zone "mycorp.com" {
    type master;
    file "internal/db.mycorp.com"; // internal zone data 
  }; 
};

view "external" {
  match-clients { any; }; // all other hosts
  zone "mycorp.com" {
    type master;
    file "external/db.mycorp.com"; // external zone data
  };
};
```

In this example, the internal view uses internal/db.mycorp.com as the zone file and would give information about servers that is only meant for internal users. The external view gives only the information needed for users to access resources on our network that we have made publicly available.

This setup ensures that external clients have no knowledge of your internal infrastructure, which can help guard against potential malicious activities. 🏰💂‍♂️

And there you have it! The `view` statement - a declarative magic trick that contributes to the organizational structure and security of BIND-operated DNS. Conjure this up in your Linux escapade, and provide custom DNS responses like a pro! ✨🎩🐇
