### 20.7 Logical Volume Management (LVM) 💽

Glad you're here! Today's admin's secret weapon is the Logical Volume Management (LVM), a method of disk space management that presents a logical view of the physical disk storage. If you've ever wrestled with wanting to resize your disk partitions after realizing you allocated too much here and too little there, then LVM is about to be your new best friend. 🤗

#### What is it?  🧐

Logical Volume Management is kind of like Legos for your storage. LVM gives you the ability to create, resize and delete partitions on your disk without needing to worry about the actual physical layout of the disk. You can think of it like a flexible layer that sits on top of your physical hard drives, allowing you to organize and assign space how you want it. 

First, let me introduce you to few concepts:

- **Physical Volume (PV)**: These are your physical disks, the actual hard drives in your system.
- **Volume Group (VG)**: A group of physical volumes that act as a unified storage pool.
- **Logical Volume (LV)**: A portion of a volume group you can allocate to a filesystem or application.

You can visualize as PV ↔ VG ↔ LV ↔ Filesystems.

#### Leveling up with LVM 🧱

To get started with LVM, you first create physical volumes from your actual disks with `pvcreate`. For a disk `/dev/sdX`, you’d use:

```
# pvcreate /dev/sdX
```

Next, you create a volume group:

```
# vgcreate myVolumeGroup /dev/sdX
```

Now let’s create a logical volume:

```
# lvcreate -L 10G myVolumeGroup -n myLogicalVolume
```

This creates a 10GB logical volume named 'myLogicalVolume' inside 'myVolumeGroup’. Now, you have a block device at `/dev/myVolumeGroup/myLogicalVolume` where you can create a filesystem, mount it, and use it just like any other disk.

LVM truly shines when you need flexibility. For example, if you later realize you need more than 10G for your logical volume, simply grab some free space from your volume group and extend the logical volume:

```
# lvextend -L+5G /dev/myVolumeGroup/myLogicalVolume
```

Here, `-L+5G` means "add 5G”. You can extend as much as you want, provided you have free space on your volume group. 

#### Wrap Up 🎁

Well done! Today, you've truly leveled up by mastering LVM. You've learned how to move past the boundaries of traditional partitioning, gained the ability to create, resize, and shuffle storage on your system, without disrupting your workflow. Doesn't it feel like having a superpower? 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️

Remember, understanding LVM is not just about managing space; it's about managing time—your time. Because the time you invest in learning LVM is time (and frustration) saved in the future. So, here’s to managing storage like a pro! 🥂

But grab your gear; we're not done yet. Next, we're delving into one of the most serious matters in the storage world—the quest for the data safety, through RAID. See you there!
