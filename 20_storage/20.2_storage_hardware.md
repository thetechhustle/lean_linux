### 20.2 Storage Hardware: The Physical Layer of Storage 🖥️💽

In the previous section 20.1, you learned the process of adding a disk to the Linux system. Congrats on that! 🎉 Now, in this 20.2, we'll explore the nitty-gritty of the actual storage hardware.

#### The Primary Types of Storage Hardware 🎈

There are primarily three types of physical storage that you might deal with:

**1. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):** 🎡

These are the most common storage devices due to their low cost and high storage capacity. They use magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information. Although not as fast as SSDs, they are suitable for storing large quantities of data cheaply.

**2. Solid State Drives (SSDs):** ⚡

SSDs are faster and more reliable than HDDs because they use flash memory to store data, thus eliminating the moving parts found in HDDs. This results in silent operation, quicker file transfer, and instant boot times. However, they're also more expensive per gigabyte.

**3. Network Attached Storage (NAS) Devices:** 🌐

For when your local storage just isn't enough! NAS devices allow multiple computers on a network to share the same storage space, paving the way to build shared, highly available storage networks. 

Let's see some Linux commands that might tell us more about these disks!

```shell
lsblk             # List all block devices.
fdisk -l          # Display disk size.
hdparm -Tt disk   # Conduct a disk speed test.
```

#### Understanding Hardware Interfaces 🛸

The interface of a drive is how it communicates with the rest of the system. Common interfaces include SATA (Serial ATA), IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics), SCSI (Small Computer System Interface), and NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express).

```shell
dmesg | grep -i sata   # Detect SATA in Linux.
dmesg | grep SCSI      # Show SCSI devices.
```

Remember, the match we make while adding a new disk to the Linux system? Right! This is where the interaction with these interfaces comes into play. All said, understanding your hardware is the first step to managing your Linux storage effectively.

On the next stop of this storage journey, in section 20.3 we'll get into the ways these drives interact with the system. Stay tuned, and happy learning! 💡
