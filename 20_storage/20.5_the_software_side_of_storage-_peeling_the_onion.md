### 20.5 The Software Side of Storage: Peeling the Onion 🧅
Before we begin, remember that storage in Linux is beautifully complex yet incredibly logical. Underneath all the technical jargon, there are just layers upon layers of processes, each doing its part to store and retrieve data. 

#### Disk Partitioning 📀

Just like a bookshelf needs divisions to categorize and easily access books, your disk needs partitions. They allow you to segregate data into logical blocks. You can use tools like `fdisk`, `parted` and `cfdisk` to manipulate these partitions:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

The above command is used to edit the disk partition table for the disk at `/dev/sda`

#### Logical Volume Management 🧠

LVM lets you manipulate storage space in a way that partitions can't. With LVM, your storage is flexible: you can create, resize, and remove logical volumes as you need. Here's how you can create an LVM:

```bash
sudo pvcreate /dev/sda1 # Initialize /dev/sda1 as a physical volume
sudo vgcreate vg0 /dev/sda1 # Create a volume group named vg0
sudo lvcreate -L 10G vg0 -n lv0 # Create a 10GB logical volume in vg0
```

#### RAID: Redundancy is Key 🔑

Data loss is a nightmare, but RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) can protect you from it. It combines several physical disks into a single logical unit for redundancy or performance improvement:

```bash
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
```

The above command creates a RAID 1 array (mirroring for redundancy) using two drives- `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sdb1`.

Remember, the goal of this section is to peel back the layers slowly and thoroughly. If a concept doesn't click right away, that's OK. Take a breather, revisit the idea, and try to relate it to something you understand. The key is to keep peeling! 🧅👍
