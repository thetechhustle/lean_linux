### 20.1 I Just Want to Add a Disk! 🆕💽

Sure, let's get started! Whether you're expanding your personal web server or taking the first step towards mastering Linux storage management, adding a disk to your system can seem daunting. 

Before we start, let's clarify a few terms. When we speak of a "disk" in this context, we refer to a physical (HDD, SSD) or a virtual storage device like a cloud disk. No matter the type, the fundamental concept remains the same—they store data.

The Linux distribution doesn't matter—as usual, we'll focus on principles that apply to all of them. Here's our plan of action:

1. **Identify the Disk:** 🧐💿

   Linux has a surprising way of naming your disks. Primary master drive is usually identified as 'sda', the primary slave as 'sdb', and so on. To display all your current disks, run the command:

   ```bash
   sudo lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT
   ```

   That'll give you a detailed list of your disks, their sizes, type, filesystems, and where they're mounted.

2. **Partitioning the Disk:** 📏🗂️

   Now that we have our new disk, it’s time to partition it. Partitioning is the process of dividing a disk into sections that can be independently managed. This increases efficiency and makes data recovery easier.

   We'll use 'fdisk' for this task:

   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   ```

   Then press `n` to create a new partition, `p` to make it primary, `1` to assign it number 1, and hit enter twice to accept the default start and end. Type `w` to write changes to the disk. Voilà! You created your partition.

3. **Creating the Filesystem:** ✍️📁

   With the partition ready, we need to mount it. But before that, it has to host a filesystem. Filesystems dictate how files are organized and accessed. Let's use Ext4 in our case:

   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
   ```

   There, the new filesystem is ready. Your Linux can now understand and interact with this disk!

4. **Mounting the Disk:** 🧗‍♂️💽

   Linux uses a tree-like structure for its filesystem, where each file and directory stems from a root ("/"). Mounting is attaching our new disk to this tree at a specific directory:

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/my_new_drive
   ```

   That's it! Your new disk is mounted at "/mnt/my_new_drive" and all set to be used.

5. **Persisting the Changes:** 💾🔄

   Unfortunately, your mount point won't survive a reboot. To make it permanent, you have to add an entry to /etc/fstab:

   ```bash
   echo '/dev/sdb1 /mnt/my_new_drive ext4 defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   ```

   Always double-check your fstab file; a mistake could prevent your system from booting!

And just like that, you've added your disk! 🙌 This is just the beginning, though. Stay tuned as we delve deeper into the world of Linux storage in the upcoming sections. Happy exploring!
