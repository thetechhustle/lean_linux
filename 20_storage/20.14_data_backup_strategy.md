### 20.14 Data Backup Strategy 🔄

The question is not if your data will be lost, but when—and the objective is to ensure that when the inevitable happens, you don’t lose any of your crucial data. 💔

#### What Is a Data Backup Strategy? 🤔

In simple terms, a data backup strategy involves the creation of duplicate copies of data, commonly known as "backups", that can be restored in the event of a data loss incident.

#### Why Do We Need a Data Backup Strategy? 💾 

Why, indeed! Besides protecting from accidental deletions and modifications, your backup strategy also protects your Linux system against hardware failures, malicious attacks, and natural disasters. Simply put, it's your plan of rescue when faced with potential data loss. 🛡️

#### Building Your Data Backup Strategy 🛠️

Your optimal backup strategy would vary depending on your exact needs and resources. However, one widely applicable principle is the 3-2-1 rule:  

- 📁 **3 different backups.** The more copies, the safer your data.  
- 💻 **2 different media.** To protect against media-specific failures, store your backups on two different types of storage media (e.g., on a hard disk and in the cloud).  
- ☁️ **1 off-site backup.** To safeguard against localized disasters—like fires, floods, or even theft—it's wise to store at least one backup at a different physical location.


#### How to Create Backups in Linux 👨‍💻

Linux offers several tools to automate the backup process. Here are a two popular ones:

1. 📦 **rsync:** A fast, versatile file copying tool that can be used to create backups. It's command-line driven, meaning you get the power without a graphical user interface. Here is how you can use rsync to backup data:

``` bash
rsync -av --delete /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
In this command:
  - `-a` stands for archive mode, which preserves symbolic links, file permissions, user & group ownerships and timestamps.
  - `-v` increases verbosity.
  - `--delete` deletes extra files from the destination directory.

2. 🗃️ **Duplicity:** Using librsync, it creates bandwidth-efficient backups in a secure manner (e.g., remote or local encrypted). Have a go at it with:

``` bash
duplicity /source/directory/ file:///destination/directory/
```
To restore:
  
``` bash
duplicity file:///destination/directory/ /restore/directory/
```

#### Test Your Backups! 🔎

Remember, a backup is only as good as its ability to restore. Plan regular tests to ensure your backups can be successfully restored. By incorporating backup checks as a regular part of your strategy, you’re one step closer to mastering Linux storage! 🏋️‍♀️

And remember: Regular backups mean regular peace of mind, so make backups a part of your Linux practice. Your future self will thank you! 💆‍♂️
