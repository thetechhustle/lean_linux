### 20.4 Attachment and Low-Level Management of Drives

Attaching a new disk to your Linux system is like giving it a new memory space to grow into. How to manage this space at a low level? Keep reading! ðŸ“˜ First, let's take a look at how the Linux system recognizes the new disk.

When you add a disk to your system, it is generally recognized as a block device. These devices are special files that represent hardware like hard drives. You can find them in your /dev directory. Typically, SATA drives are named /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, and so on, depending on the order they are connected.

Here's how you can list the block devices currently attached to your system:

```bash
$ lsblk
```

This command will detail all block devices, their sizes, and their mount points.

Once we have our disk recognized, we can move on to partitioning. Linux supports many types of partition table, but the most common and widely supported one is called a GUID Partition Table, or ,GPT.

To create a GPT on your new disk, we use the excessively powerful tool `gdisk`.

Do this by entering the following command, replacing 'X' with the correct letter for your disk:

```bash
$ sudo gdisk /dev/sdX
```

Next, we need to create a new filesystem. This is akin to creating the pages in our fresh new book. Here's how:

```bash
$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdX1
```

In this command, '-t ext4' specifies the type of filesystem, 'ext4' being a common choice.

You've now formatted your drive, but you're not finished. Next, we need to make this new storage space available to the Linux system. This is achieved through a process known as mounting.

You need to create a mount point, essentially a directory path, where your filesystem will live:

```bash
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/my_drive
```

Now, mount your device:

```bash
$ sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/my_drive
```

Voila! ðŸŽ‰ You've attached a new disk, formatted it, and mounted it to your system! 

Remember: attaching a disk might seem low-level, but understanding the plumbing of your system will help you in the long run. Stick with it. Practice these commands until you can recall them from memory, and keep pushing! The gateway to Linux expertise is perseverance and practice.

*Note:* All steps mentioned here should be performed with utmost care as they may lead to data loss if mishandled.
