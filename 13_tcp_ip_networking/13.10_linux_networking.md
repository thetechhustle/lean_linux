## 13.10 Linux Networking

Linux is the chosen system for many network administrators due to its impressive functionality and flexibility. It provides unending capabilities for network configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Let's dive into the world of Linux networking in this section!

### Understanding Linux Network Interfaces 🖧

In Linux, a network interface is the software that allows interactions between the hardware and the network. Each interface has a unique name, like `eth0` for the first Ethernet interface, `lo` for the loopback interface, or `wlan0` for the first wireless interface. You'll use these names when configuring networking on your Linux system. Command `ip link` shows all your network interfaces:

```bash
$ ip link
```

### Static and Dynamic IP Allocation 🗝️↔️

IP addresses for Linux can be statically (permanently) assigned or dynamically assigned via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). Static IP is often used when a device needs a consistent address, like a server. Use the `ip addr` command to assign static IP:

```bash
$ sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
```

For dynamic IP assignment, Network Manager, a service running in many Linux OS, communicates with DHCP server. Can check and control status of Network Manager with:

```bash
$ nmcli networking on
$ nmcli con down id 'Connection 1'
$ nmcli con up id 'Connection 1'
```

### Network Config Files: Where the Secrets Reside 📜🔍

Your network configuration files hold your networking settings. In Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you'll find these in `/etc/network/interfaces`. In Red Hat systems like Fedora, they live in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` for the first Ethernet interface eth0.

```bash
$ cat /etc/network/interfaces
```

### The All-Seeing netstat and ss Tools 👁️🔧

`netstat` and `ss` are essential tools for viewing network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics. They provide a real-time snapshot of what's happening on your network!

```bash
$ netstat -a

# Or with ss:
$ ss -a
```

That's all for our journey through Linux networking. This is but a taste of the vast capabilities Linux offers for networking. There's more to explore like iptables, firewalld, DNS resolution, and more. Keep experimenting, keep exploring! You're on your way to becoming a Linux networking whiz. 💻⭐
