## 13.2 Networking Basics

Every digital adventure needs a solid foundation, and our journey into networking with Linux is no different. Before we dig into TCP/IP itself, let's first unravel the core concepts that underpin all networking. We deal with Basics 🍎📚, the layers and the models that make everything run smoothly behind the scenes. 

### The OSI Model 🎂

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model provides a framework for understanding how network protocols interact and work together. Think of it as a seven-layered cake, with each slice contributing a different yet crucial flavor. 😋

1. **Physical:** Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium, like cables or wireless.
2. **Data Link:** Handles error-free transmission over the network.
3. **Network:** Introduces the concept of routing and determines the path data takes to reach its destination.
4. **Transport:** Provides reliable or unreliable delivery and performs error checking.
5. **Session:** Manages the interacting sessions between devices.
6. **Presentation:** Transforms data format to create a standard interface for the application layer.
7. **Application:** Provides different services to the applications.

### Introduction to TCP/IP 🌐

While the OSI model is mainly theoretical, the TCP/IP model plays out on the grand stage of the global Internet every day. It originated in the ARPANET, a precursor to the Internet, funded by the U.S Department of Defense. 

The TCP/IP model has four layers:

1. **Network Interface:** Corresponds largely to the Physical and Data Link layers in OSI and is responsible for data transmission.
2. **Internet:** Works akin to the Network layer in OSI and handles the routing of data.
3. **Transport:** TCP and UDP protocols living here ensure reliable data delivery.
4. **Application:** This layer is home to protocols you may be familiar with—HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, and DNS for domain name resolution.

### Ports and Sockets 🔌

In networking, terms like Ports and Sockets are thrown often. Simply put, a socket represents a single connection between two network applications. This connection is bi-directional, and both applications can both send and receive through the pipeline. 

A port, on the other hand, is an endpoint in an operating system. It's essentially a number that's attached to each packet for transportation, guiding it to the correct process on its arrival. 

There are well-known port numbers in use. For example, HTTP usually uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443.

### IP Addresses 💼

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical label for each device in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions; identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network.

There are two versions of IP addresses in use: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4, the most common as of now, uses 32-bit addresses, producing over 4 billion unique addresses. IPv6, with its 128-bit address space, was introduced to tackle the exhaustion of IPv4.

Hold onto these basics; they will become your touring partners as you navigate the rivers and streams of Networking. Now, equipped with the basics, let's dive deeper into the vast ocean of Networking with Linux!🌊 🏊‍♂️🚀
