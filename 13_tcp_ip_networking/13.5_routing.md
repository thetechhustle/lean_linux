## Section 13.5: Routing- Mapping the Data Journey 🧭

"We're on a road to nowhere"— if you're a fan of the band, Talking Heads, you might love this line. But our data packets surely wouldn't. They need to know precisely where to go. This roadmap is what we call a routing table. And guess what we will be exploring in this section? Yes, you got it— routing! 🛣️💻

Routing in a network is like the GPS we use while traveling; it guides the data packets to reach their destination without getting lost in the network's maze. The router plays the crucial role of a traffic conductor, regulating and dictating the path for every data packet. 🗺️🚦

### Understanding the Routing Table 📚📍

A routing table is a document of sorts that stores details on paths for packet transmission—kinda like a Google Maps for your data. Let's use the `netstat -rn` command in Linux to pull up this network navigational chart.

```
$ netstat -rn
```

This command will exhibit something similar to the following:

```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
```

This table, though it appears somewhat cryptic at first glance, is really just a treasure map for your data. Let's break it down:

- **Destination**: The packet's final destination network.
- **Gateway**: The immediate next hop that packets should be sent to.
- **Genmask**: The network mask for the destination. The mask helps determine the IP network's size.
- **Flags**: These provide additional information about the route.
- **Iface**: Refers to the network interface to be used to send the packet. 

With this metadata in hand, the router can make smart decisions about where to send your packet next, optimizing for factors like load and latency. 🚀📍

### Adding & Removing Routes🚏🔧

In Linux, you can manually add or remove routes in the routing table using the `route` command.

To add a route:

```bash
$ sudo route add -net 192.0.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1
```

To delete a route:

```bash
$ sudo route del -net 192.0.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1
```

Remember, changes made with the `route` command are temporary and will be removed after a system reboot. To make permanent changes, you will need to modify appropriate network configuration files—a job for a later section! 💾🔄

Routing is an overhead view of the interconnected paths your data can navigate. As you gain familiarity with this routing view, you will gain the power to guide data expediently and efficiently. A power akin to that of a network's air traffic controller. Be confident—your directions can help data reach its destination. Your journey into the world of TCP/IP networking continues to unfold.
