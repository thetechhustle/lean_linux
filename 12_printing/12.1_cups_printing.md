## 12.1 CUPS Printing üñ®Ô∏è

The centerpiece of our exploration in this subchapter is CUPS - an acronym for Common Unix Printing System. CUPS is an open-source printing system developed by Apple Inc. to simplify the process of printing from applications. It is widely adopted in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. 

CUPS use the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) as the basis for managing print jobs and queues. It also includes the command-line utilities for job submission, job management, and printer management. 

Let's get started with our practical guide:

### üíª Installing and Setting Up CUPS

The first step requires us to install CUPS. Most Linux distributions already come with CUPS preinstalled. But, if your system does not have it, you can install it using the package manager of your Linux distribution.

For Ubuntu or other Debian-based systems, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cups
```

For RedHat or CentOS, use:

```bash
sudo yum install cups
```

Now that CUPS is installed, let's start the CUPS service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start cups
```

To enable CUPS to start on boot, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable cups
```

The next step is to add a printer. Let's assume we add a printer named 'Office_Printer'. First, you need to go to the CUPS web interface. Open a browser and type `http://localhost:631`.

Then, follow these steps:

- Choose 'Administration' ‚û°Ô∏è 'Add Printer'.
- Select your printer from the list ‚û°Ô∏è Select 'Continue'.
- Provide 'Name', 'Description', and 'Location'. Use 'Office_Printer' as 'Name' ‚û°Ô∏è Select 'Continue'.
- Select the appropriate driver for the printer ‚û°Ô∏è Select 'Add Printer'.
- Set the default options for the printer ‚û°Ô∏è Select 'Set Default Options'.

Your printer is now added and configured!

### üìù Printing a Test Page

To verify your setup, let's print a test page. Use the following command:

```bash
echo "Test Page" | lp -d Office_Printer
```

Congrats, you have mastered CUPS installation and setup. From here, you can manage your print jobs and printer with ease! 

Continue this journey to unfold more secrets of printing in Linux, such as CUPS server administration and troubleshooting. Remember, practice makes permanent. Happy printing! üéâ
