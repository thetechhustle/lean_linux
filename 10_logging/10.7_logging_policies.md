### 10.7_logging_policies: Navigating Successfully with a Sound Strategy 📚🧭🔐

Defining the policies for logging forms the backbone of a secure, compliant, and efficient Linux system administration. A log policy specifies what logs to keep, how long to keep them, how to structure them and who gets access to those logs. Having a well-crafted logging policy helps safeguard your system, maintain compliance standards, and get the most valuable insights out of your logs.

#### 10.7.1_What Should Be Logged? 🖊️📜

The type of events to be logged primarily depends on your enterprise needs. However, typically, erring on the side of more logging than limited is usually helpful. Collectively, data from events like authentication, installation, system changes, network activities and errors can help you understand your system's health and troubleshoot any issues.

```bash
# an example of the type of events logged
auth.info sshd[1212]: Accepted 1234_key for user from 123.45.67.89 1234_56:22
```

#### 10.7.2_Log Retention Duration 🗓️⏳

The retention period for logs is a balance between the data storage capabilities and the need for historical data. Many regulations require retaining logs for a specific duration, usually between 90 days to a year. sysklogd, for instance, offers log rotation and removal for managing storage.

```bash
#/etc/logrotate.conf specifies the rotation schedule
/home/usr/logs/*.log {
weekly
rotate 5
compress
dateext
}
```
In this example, logs rotate weekly, store for five cycles, and compress using gzip to save space.

#### 10.7.3_Log Structure and Organization 🌳🗂️

Organize logs in a way that's easy to navigate and search. Use systematic naming conventions, date information, and segregation based on services or tasks. In Linux, `/var/log` typically stores logs, with several subdirectories for specific tasks or services.

#### 10.7.4_Privilege and Log Access Control 🚪🔓

Reduce the risk of unauthorized access or alteration of logs by regulating who gets access to log data. Use Linux's permission and ownership model effectively to ensure such security. 

```bash
# 'ls -l' lists current permissions
ls -l /var/log/syslog
```
The output gives the owner (root), group (adm) and other permissions for the syslog file.

By creating a well-rounded logging policy, you form the bedrock of your system's operational transparency and accountability. Remember, logging is not just a record of the past, but a compass that guides your system's future. It's an indispensable tool in your Linux toolkit, shaping your journey in the vast open-source landscape.
